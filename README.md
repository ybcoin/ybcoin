Ultracoin is a hybrid proof-of-work / proof-of-stake coin, whereby active nodes are involved in the mining of blocks if they hold Ultracoin. With Ultracoin you can send and receive currency worldwide to friends, family or business partners. You may even exchange it for other currencies or simply use it to buy goods. Miners are currently awarded with 50 new Ultracoins per block, an amount which gets halved roughly every 990.000 blocks. The Ultracoin network is therefore scheduled to produce 100 million Ultracoins, which is almost 4.5 times as many currency units as Bitcoin.

Ultracoin can be mined with both CPU's and GPU's. Furthermore, with an ASIC resistant Scrypt Jane base, you can feel at ease. This will ensure that you won't be surprised by new hardware technologies. UTC is a hybrid proof-of-work/proof-of-stake coin, whereby active nodes are involved in the mining of blocks if they hold UTC.
